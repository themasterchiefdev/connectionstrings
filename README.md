### Project Description

This is tiny project is built for quickly generating connection strings.

#### Problem Statement

We want to have a quick and easy way to generate connection strings which can be used when adding/changing the registry keys or use them in the configuration files(ex: app.config or web.config).

There are the many sites out there which provide the connection strings but the problem I had was that the connection strings need to be copied over and then edit it manually.

#### Task:

I need to come-up with an app which would provide an easy workflow/wizard to

1.  Select the Database Provider
2.  Select the connection type
3.  Enter the Instance Name
4.  Enter the database name
5.  Enter the login Id
6.  Enter the Password

Finally, generate the connection string which can be just copied over and used without fiddling with it anymore.

I would also want to learn ReactJs while building the app.

#### Action

I started out building this tiny web app using ReactJs.

#### Result

[Generate Connection Strings](https://yvrkarthik.github.io/connectionstrings/) web app came into existence.

This App evolves as I pick-up new techniques and learn new skills in ReactJS.
